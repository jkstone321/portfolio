# Jordan's Portfolio

This is a portfolio that I have been working on to showcase my skills in full-stack web development. The pictures will take you to projects that I have made and there are links that you can use to get in contact with me.

### NOTE
This website is currently incomplete. The pictures do not link to anything because this is the first project I have done. All of the content is currently placeholders. In a professional setting I would never use an image of Pepe or Mokokos dancing, I was just having a little fun. I also was unsure of if we had to make it exactly like the images given to us or if we make it personal. I certainly will make it more personal and professional as we get projects to add to it.
